This is a collection of code utilized in order to make a datalogger for the purpouse of tracking weather data. All data is collected using an arduino running the transmitter.ino script, which collects data from sensors and transmits it using an rflink. This data is then read by the logger.py script which is running on a raspberry pi that has an rf receiver connected to the GPIO. This data is then uploaded to a MySQL server using credentials listed in a file.
